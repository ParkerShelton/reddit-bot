1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Am I the asshole for not cooking with my

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
food labs group?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I (17 male) am currently in a foods and

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
nutrition class at my high school.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Every Friday, we cook something.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I often do the bare minimum with my team

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
to at least seem like a decent human

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
being, but the truth is, I have horrible

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
social anxiety with people I barely know.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I think differently, too; my brain

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
notices things, and I often question them

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
a lot forcefully.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
This is because I was diagnosed with

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
autism when I was younger, so my brain

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
functions somewhat differently, and I

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
tend to also be more sensitive to sounds.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I often pace around the kitchen in class,

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
figuring out what comes next, cracking my

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
knuckles or tapping my fingers as a way

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
of stimming.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Two weeks ago, my dog unfortunately

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
passed away, and I took a break from

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
school for about two days, returning on

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Friday.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I opted out of cooking because my

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
headspace was not good at all.

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The next week, I felt ill; my head was

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
hurting, so I took a break again.

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You can probably guess what happened

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
next, but I did not show up last week; I

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
got sick and needed antibiotics.

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
In fact, my entire family was sick and

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
still is.

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I am going back tomorrow, on Monday, and

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I am scared they will think I left them

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
to do all the work, that I am a

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
freeloader of some sort.

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
We also had an ingredient list-type

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
summative that we had to do, and my group

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
never did it.

41
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
The teacher said if we did not do it, we

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
need to bring in our own ingredients to

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
make the meal instead of her buying them.

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So, I am kind of in trouble now.

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I do not have a job either, so... yeah.

46
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Anyway, that is all my talk.
