1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Am I the asshole for not wanting to

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
attend my older sister's baby shower?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
My older sister and her husband are

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
excited to welcome a baby girl in January.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We will be celebrating with family and

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
friends at their baby shower on October

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
11th.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Now, I will be honest, I, a 31 male, do

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
not like baby showers.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
My family does not seem to get that.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It feels like they are begging me to go,

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
but I really do not want to.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I am not big on family gatherings either.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I understand some people might be upset

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
if I do not show up, but I cannot live my

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
life trying to please everyone.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I am more of a recluse and enjoy being

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
alone.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I can support in other ways.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
What do you guys think?
