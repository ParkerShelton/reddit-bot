Am I the asshole for not wanting to attend my older sister's baby shower?
My older sister and her husband are excited to welcome a baby girl in January.
We will be celebrating with family and friends at their baby shower on October 11th.
Now, I will be honest, I, a 31 male, do not like baby showers.
My family does not seem to get that.
It feels like they are begging me to go, but I really do not want to.
I am not big on family gatherings either.
I understand some people might be upset if I do not show up, but I cannot live my life trying to please everyone.
I am more of a recluse and enjoy being alone.
I can support in other ways.
What do you guys think?

Am I the asshole for not cooking with my food labs group?
I (17 male) am currently in a foods and nutrition class at my high school.
Every Friday, we cook something.
I often do the bare minimum with my team to at least seem like a decent human being, but the truth is, I have horrible social anxiety with people I barely know.
I think differently, too; my brain notices things, and I often question them a lot forcefully.
This is because I was diagnosed with autism when I was younger, so my brain functions somewhat differently, and I tend to also be more sensitive to sounds.
I often pace around the kitchen in class, figuring out what comes next, cracking my knuckles or tapping my fingers as a way of stimming.
Two weeks ago, my dog unfortunately passed away, and I took a break from school for about two days, returning on Friday.
I opted out of cooking because my headspace was not good at all.
The next week, I felt ill; my head was hurting, so I took a break again.
You can probably guess what happened next, but I did not show up last week; I got sick and needed antibiotics.
In fact, my entire family was sick and still is.
I am going back tomorrow, on Monday, and I am scared they will think I left them to do all the work, that I am a freeloader of some sort.
We also had an ingredient list-type summative that we had to do, and my group never did it.
The teacher said if we did not do it, we need to bring in our own ingredients to make the meal instead of her buying them.
So, I am kind of in trouble now.
I do not have a job either, so... yeah.
Anyway, that is all my talk.

Dealing with social anxiety and autism in a high school cooking class can be tough, especially when it feels like your group is relying on you. Sharing my story and wondering, am I the asshole for not cooking with my group? #aita #autismawareness #socialanxiety #highschoollife #mentalhealthmatters
