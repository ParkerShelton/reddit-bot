Title: Am I the asshole for not cooking with my food labs group?

I (17 male) am currently in a foods and nutrition class at my high school.
Every Friday, we cook something.
I often do the bare minimum with my team to at least seem like a decent human being, but the truth is, I have horrible social anxiety with people I barely know.
I think differently, too; my brain notices things, and I often question them a lot forcefully.
This is because I was diagnosed with autism when I was younger, so my brain functions somewhat differently, and I tend to also be more sensitive to sounds.
I often pace around the kitchen in class, figuring out what comes next, cracking my knuckles or tapping my fingers as a way of stimming.
Two weeks ago, my dog unfortunately passed away, and I took a break from school for about two days, returning on Friday.
I opted out of cooking because my headspace was not good at all.
The next week, I felt ill; my head was hurting, so I took a break again.
You can probably guess what happened next, but I did not show up last week; I got sick and needed antibiotics.
In fact, my entire family was sick and still is.
I am going back tomorrow, on Monday, and I am scared they will think I left them to do all the work, that I am a freeloader of some sort.
We also had an ingredient list-type summative that we had to do, and my group never did it.
The teacher said if we did not do it, we need to bring in our own ingredients to make the meal instead of her buying them.
So, I am kind of in trouble now.
I do not have a job either, so... yeah.
Anyway, that is all my talk.
