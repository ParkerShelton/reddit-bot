Would I be the asshole if I confronted a dog owner over howling? 
There is a dog owner with some kind of hound that often goes to a cafe right outside my apartment. 
He goes on weekdays, weekends, and not at any recognizable schedule that I can identify. 
It's a no dogs allowed cafe, so he keeps his dog outside while he orders, then stays for a while (shorter on weekdays, but hours on weekends) to chat with his friends.
 
He comes around 8:30-9 in the mornings and his dog isn't howling the entire time that he's there, but it is regular and his dog is quite loud. 
I live on a busy street, so I'm accustomed to noise and sleep through traffic, sirens, and chatter, but this dog has been consistently one that wakes me up.
 
Would I be the asshole if I asked him to address his dog's howling or consider leaving his dog at home? 
I know that this is something hound owners can work on (I have trained dogs before), but not every dog is the same.

Am I the asshole for my neighbor's "shared" fence drama.
We recently spent over $20,000.00 to put up a new fence around our yard.
We had just a chain link fence, and we put up a 6-foot high custom maple wood fence.
We told all our neighbors that we would be doing this.
No one had a problem with this.

The neighbor behind us had previously taken their fence down, leaving only our chain link fence between our properties.
This would not be a problem, but they have a swimming pool, and the laws for security and safety deem it necessary for them to have a 6-foot fence.
(This was at the beginning of the summer, and we were not planning on putting our fence up until the late fall or the following spring.)

We ended up not doing the fence until the following spring, and the neighbor never put their fence back up.
Fast forward to a few weeks ago, we get a letter from the neighbor requesting us to sign and get notarized a "shared fence" agreement for the town that is required when parties share a fence and one has a pool.
Am I the asshole for throwing the paper in the trash, or should I have contacted this neighbor?

Am I the asshole for going to a school I want to go to, even if I leave my friends behind?
Ok, to make one thing clear, these are not my best friends at my old school.
They have many other friends with whom they are much closer, so my leaving does not make them friendless.

So, in my city, there is a very, very prestigious and selective school that goes from 7 to 12.
You have to take a challenging test, and I was originally put on the waitlist for the school.
Anyways, when school started, after my first day at my old school, I was accepted off the waitlist.
I was overjoyed, and I knew my friends would be somewhat mad or sad, but I thought that maybe they would be partially happy for me, and for the most part, I was right.
Most of my friends were actually really nice, but two of them were the exact opposite.
When I told them, they said that I was super mean for leaving them, that I did not deserve my acceptance, and that I was going to hate it.
I understand why they would be mad, but they were just so furious at me.
They were confused as to why I liked the other school more (I was being bullied at my old school, which they apparently did not know), and I was slightly confused by the difference in my other friends' reactions.

Am I overreacting for feeling like my long-distance partner is not putting in enough effort?
My partner and I have been dating for about four months.
We met while he was in my city for a work project, and we had an amazing connection.
When the project ended, he moved back to his city, which is about a five-hour drive away.
We decided to try the long-distance thing.

At first, it was great.
We would video call almost every night, text throughout the day, and he would send me little "thinking of you" messages.
But over the last month, things have changed.
The calls have become less frequent, sometimes just a few minutes long.
He takes hours to reply to texts, and when he does, they are short.
He says he is just really busy and stressed with his new job.

The problem is, I feel like I am the only one making an effort.
I am always the one to initiate planning our next visit or suggesting we watch a movie together online.
Last weekend, I found out he went to a concert with his friends.
I was happy for him, but it also stung because he had told me he was "too swamped with work" to video call that night.

I finally told him how I was feeling, that I was lonely and felt like a low priority.
He got defensive and said I was being needy and overreacting to a "busy patch."
He said long distance requires trust and that I was suffocating him.
Now I feel guilty and confused.
Am I overreacting by expecting more consistent communication, or are my feelings valid?
I really like him, but this is starting to make me feel insecure.

My husband keeps lying over stupid things - Am I overreacting.
It is the fourth time I find my husband lying to me about trivial things.
Things that have zero importance, but I now no longer feel that I can trust anything he says.
If he is lying about insignificant things, what is going to happen when something important comes up?
Lying is something I consider unacceptable in my partner.
I have mentioned how much it bothers me, and how it affects the way I see him.
I no longer see our relationship lasting, as I do not feel I can trust him.
Am I overreacting?

Am I overreacting into thinking we are making a mistake by having an abortion?
My girlfriend is pregnant, it is 4 weeks (she was coming off the birth control, we were meeting after 2 months, so one night we ran out of condoms, and she took a pill the next day).
The context is that we are in a long-distance relationship.
We have plans to get married and for her to move to Europe.
Currently, my company has shut down, so I am on notice until January and will get my severance.
I have a few interviews lined up.
We are a twenty-nine male and a thirty-two female.
We decided that we do not want to keep the baby due to the timing, and with neither of us potentially having a job, if somehow I cannot find a job and she resigns from her current one, and then cannot move because I will not be able to sponsor her if I do not have a job.
Currently, I am also eligible for citizenship.
And we decided we will try for a kid once we get citizenship, a stable job, and she is with me and no longer in a long-distance relationship.
It sounds all logical.
I know she is sad too.
But some part of me just wants to see and keep the kid and figure stuff out later.
I seriously do not know what to do.
I love her.
We have been together for 14 months.
