Am I the asshole for my neighbor's "shared" fence drama.
We recently spent over $20,000.00 to put up a new fence around our yard.
We had just a chain link fence, and we put up a 6-foot high custom maple wood fence.
We told all our neighbors that we would be doing this.
No one had a problem with this.

The neighbor behind us had previously taken their fence down, leaving only our chain link fence between our properties.
This would not be a problem, but they have a swimming pool, and the laws for security and safety deem it necessary for them to have a 6-foot fence.
(This was at the beginning of the summer, and we were not planning on putting our fence up until the late fall or the following spring.)

We ended up not doing the fence until the following spring, and the neighbor never put their fence back up.
Fast forward to a few weeks ago, we get a letter from the neighbor requesting us to sign and get notarized a "shared fence" agreement for the town that is required when parties share a fence and one has a pool.
Am I the asshole for throwing the paper in the trash, or should I have contacted this neighbor?

Am I the asshole for going to a school I want to go to, even if I leave my friends behind?
Ok, to make one thing clear, these are not my best friends at my old school.
They have many other friends with whom they are much closer, so my leaving does not make them friendless.

So, in my city, there is a very, very prestigious and selective school that goes from 7 to 12.
You have to take a challenging test, and I was originally put on the waitlist for the school.
Anyways, when school started, after my first day at my old school, I was accepted off the waitlist.
I was overjoyed, and I knew my friends would be somewhat mad or sad, but I thought that maybe they would be partially happy for me, and for the most part, I was right.
Most of my friends were actually really nice, but two of them were the exact opposite.
When I told them, they said that I was super mean for leaving them, that I did not deserve my acceptance, and that I was going to hate it.
I understand why they would be mad, but they were just so furious at me.
They were confused as to why I liked the other school more (I was being bullied at my old school, which they apparently did not know), and I was slightly confused by the difference in my other friends' reactions.

Am I the asshole for telling my parent to not turn on the fridge?
For context, I live with my grandmother, and I have been living with her since I was a kid, and my parent moved in later on.
I am 23 years old, and she is 50 years old; I do plan to move out soon.
This post is not about that; it is just context for the situation.
So, we just got a fridge due to the old one breaking down.
We were told we needed to wait an hour before attempting to switch it on.
My parent was not there for this information.
She asked my grandmother why it was not on, and my grandmother told her it must wait an hour.
I said it can only be put on at 12:30.
It was 11:30.
She, despite this, attempted to plug it in and start it up too early.
I told her again, "Please do not switch it on until 12:30."
She said she cannot do that, as she is leaving the house now for something.
Again, she attempted to do it.
I told her I could do it; I read the manual, and it needs to wait until 12:30.
She then proceeded to yell at me, saying, "I am not a moron," "fuck off," and "you are such an asshole."
Was I really an asshole?
I just wanted to make sure we do not break the new fridge.
My grandmother cannot afford another one.
This is not the first time she has yelled at me over something like this.
I want to know if I am the asshole, so that I can make sure I do not do it again, as I do not want tension for my grandmother.

Am I overreacting, 
my boyfriend complimented another woman. 
My boyfriend and I went to a party. 
Our friend was there and looking very nice. 
I had also spent time on my appearance and thought I looked nice too. 
My boyfriend complimented her in front of me and said nothing about me all night. 
It really hurt my feelings because I had spent time selecting a dress and thought I looked nice. 
At the end of the night, I asked if he thought I looked nice, and I got a noncommittal grunt. 
I feel like giving up and not even trying. 
I am skinny and fit and take care of myself. 
I feel like I am not good enough. 
Am I overreacting?

Am I overreacting 
over my coworker punching me in the face?
So, I work doing repairs on train tracks, 
and yesterday afternoon I was doing this job, 
and all of a sudden there was this kid, 
like a thirteen-year-old male, 
on a dirt bike waving at us.
Now, obviously, it is not safe for a kid to be around 
while we are repairing train tracks, 
so we tried to shoo him away, 
but he just kept on waving.
I decided to scare him off 
by pulling out my revolver and firing a few shots, 
making sure not to hit him.
I guess my coworker thought I was actually going to shoot the kid 
because he yelled "NOOOOOO" when I pulled it out. 
I would never hurt a child, though; 
my boss did not care, but I think it startled him.
In hindsight, I think I overreacted a bit.
Later, on my smoke break, 
my coworker seemed really upset 
that I put the kid in danger or something.
I lit up my cigarette 
and said, "Hey, shit happens, right?" 
to try to be friendly.
But then he just punches me in the face!
I told my boss about this later, 
and he seems to be on my side, 
but refuses to fire him.
Should I quit?

Am I overreacting about my husband's new friends?
My husband made a few friends on a work trip last year, and since then, they have been meeting up once or twice a month.
It is a mixed group of men and women.
What feels strange to me is that I have never been invited to join them.
He says he assumes I would get bored or that I do not know them well enough, but it still feels off that none of them have ever suggested meeting me either.
I am not trying to be part of every hangout or anything, but is it not pretty normal to include a spouse at least occasionally in new friendships?
After going over this several times, he said he understood and included me once, but after that, as well, no one made plans by the group to include me in it.
For context, we dated during Covid, so I never got that "meet my friends" phase I always imagined and hoped for.
I think that is part of why this situation feels especially weird to me.
